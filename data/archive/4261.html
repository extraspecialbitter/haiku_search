<p>
My daughter Rebekah, her husband Jason, and their 4 (!) teenage (!!)
<br />
daughters (!!!) spent most of this past week with us. There was only one
<br />
controversy. I slipped by saying that I was upset with Google for giving
<br />
into Trump's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America. Rebekah's
<br />
contention was that &quot;a lot of people wanted to do that&quot; over the years,
<br />
which, while true, didn't make it right. I felt my blood pressure rise, and
<br />
apologized - not for what I said, but that I had disrupted four days of
<br />
relative peace on our last morning together. After all, I had worn my &quot;Gulf
<br />
of Mexico&quot; t-shirt on their second day there, and no one uttered a word.
<br />
<p>The reason for the off-cycle visit (they normally go on furlough for
<br />
several months every 3 years, but are here for a month one year early) is
<br />
that my granddaughter Righteous (18) will be attending college in Wisconsin
<br />
(Ethnos 360 Bible Institute) at the end of the month, and they basically
<br />
wanted to visit everyone they knew in the States before dropping her off
<br />
and returning to Kenya. Having determined early on that I would encourage
<br />
my children to make their own decisions, I offered no opposition to Rebekah
<br />
attending a missionary school and then becoming a missionary in Africa,
<br />
proselytizing to Muslims in Garissa. Given that all four daughters have
<br />
grown up in Kenya as &quot;MKs&quot; (missionary kids), it seems plausible enough
<br />
that they would want to follow in their parents' footsteps to become
<br />
missionaries as well. Given that they were homeschooled by Rebekah, it's
<br />
not surprising that there was little science or math in their curriculum -
<br />
which is a pity, as they're all bright, well-spoken girls with boundless
<br />
potential. That said, I have no problem with their choices.
<br />
<p>My main peeve is hearing not only that they all want to get married, but
<br />
that they have some definite ideas about how many children they want to
<br />
have. As if being a wife and mother is the only realistic option available.
<br />
My hope is that Righteous will benefit from being outside of her walled
<br />
compound, but I suspect her Bible college will have its own &quot;walls.&quot; I also
<br />
worry that her first exposure to boys, whose hormones are likely to turn
<br />
Bible school into a quest for biblical knowledge, will be a harrowing
<br />
experience. On the plus side, her father Jason, a good ol' boy from
<br />
Virginia, will likely be on the first red-eye west if any boy gets the
<br />
wrong idea. Or even the right idea with the wrong girl. He's a big dude,
<br />
and a protective one at that.
<br />
<p>I was back to work today for the first time all week. An email from the
<br />
President of WHOI stated gloomily that in light of the NSF's new &quot;guidance&quot;
<br />
to require an attestation from all grant recipients that they have no DEI
<br />
language in place and that the entire institution would be audited to
<br />
ensure compliance. NSF is WHOI's largest source of funding these days, but
<br />
the directive goes beyond this in stating that the entire campus will be
<br />
scrutinized for signs of gaiety or - far worse - transgression. The former
<br />
Chief DEI Officer (now Chief of Work Climate, or something like that) is an
<br />
out lesbian who has been tasked with walking the tightrope of compliance
<br />
with this Executive [dis]Order. I'm not gay, but I value working in an
<br />
environment where all are welcomed and valued. This is - in my opinion - a
<br />
huge step backwards.
<br />
<p>Which is to say that I have 134 days (or less) left before retirement...
<br />
